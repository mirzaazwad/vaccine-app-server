# Server Side for Vaccine App

In this app, we tried to integrate a dev ops based approach, with a CI/CD pipeline that consists of github actions being configured thorugh the yml workflows. We also integrated google cloud build

system was:

as the employed development stack, that being MERN.

Additionally we also used:
